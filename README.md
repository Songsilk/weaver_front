## Project Description  
**Weaver** consists of a web application that enables users to share personal or professional information, similar to Linktree. Each user can create and customize a personal page by adding relevant links, contact details, and other key information. The application also allows users to save other profiles to a personal contact list and establish relationships between contacts through notes that describe where they met, impressions, or shared experiences.
